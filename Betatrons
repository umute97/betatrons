Betatrons

• circular induction accelerator used for electrons/positrons
• beam acts as a multi-turn secondary
• single-pulsed power modulator @ a few kV drives the input

• *maximum electron energy*: 300 MeV. Limits:
   • practical size of pulsed magnets
   • synchrotron radiation

# Principles

*Setup*

• toroidal vacuum chamber encircles core of a large magnet
• magnetic fields are produced by pulsed coils
• mag. flux inside the vac. chamber changes with time
• *increasing flux → azimuthal electric field → acceleration*
• proper choice of air gap → force mag. field to transport region → confine path of electrons to circular orbit
• shaped mag. fields for beam focusing

*Math*

• *Equilib. of forces:* {{{plaintex R = \frac{\gamma m v_\theta}{e B_z(R)} = \frac{p_\theta}{e B_z(R)} }}}
• *Induction:* {{{plaintex \frac{\d\Phi}{\d t} = 2\pi RE_\theta}}}
• *Eq. of motion:* {{{plaintex \frac{\d p_\theta}{\d t} = eE_\theta }}}
• *Rearrange/Integrate above - Betatron Condition* {{{plaintex B_z(R) = \frac{\Delta\Phi}{2\pi R^2}  }}}
